Certainly! Here's a clean and professional rephrasing of your reported issues and feature suggestions across each tab of your Order Management System:

---

### 🛠️ **Feature Enhancements & Bug Report Summary**

#### 📊 **Dashboard Tab**

* **Quick Actions UI**: The current UI for the *Quick Actions* section could be improved. Please consider redesigning it using a more intuitive and visually engaging layout.

---

#### 📦 **Orders Tab**

* **Order Filters**: The filter tabs (All, Placed, Processing, Completed) correctly display the item counts in brackets, but the actual filtering functionality is not working as expected. Selecting a tab should filter the visible orders accordingly.
* **Order Card – Print**: For the *Print* functionality, we should integrate **QZ Tray** to handle printing directly from the browser to local printers.
* **Order Card – View Button**:

  * Clicking the *View* button currently shows minimal information. It should instead display the **item names along with their respective quantities** in a readable format.
  * Clarify the purpose of the **three-dot (⋮) menu** on each order card. If unused, consider removing it or adding meaningful actions (e.g., edit, duplicate order, delete).

#### 🧾 **Point of Sale (POS) Tab**

* Overall functionality is good.
* **Payment Section**: The *Payment* area currently appears empty or blank. We should display a summary of the transaction (e.g., items purchased, total amount, selected payment method) before the order is confirmed.

---

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Customers Tab**

* **View Orders Button**: The *View Orders* button for each customer is not functioning.

  * Expected behavior: Clicking this should either filter the orders in the *Orders* tab to show only that customer’s history, or open a detailed view with their order timeline.

---

#### 📈 **Analytics Tab**

* This section looks great overall.
* If any key analytics (e.g., sales by category, order trends over time) are missing, feel free to enhance the visuals or metrics as necessary.

---

#### ⚙️ **Settings Tab**

* The existing settings are functional.
* **Printer Configuration**: Add a section for **printer connectivity**, especially since QZ Tray is being used in the Orders tab. This should include:

  * Printer selection from available devices
  * Test print functionality
  * Connection status indicator (e.g., “Connected to QZ Tray”)

Let me know if you’d like me to format this as a GitHub issue list or project task board. I can also generate UI mockups or code snippets for any of the above enhancements.
