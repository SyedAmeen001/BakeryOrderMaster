We are developing a robust, full-stack Order Management System (OMS) tailored for a bakery business, with support for online orders, Point of Sale (POS) functionality, and a secure admin dashboard — all running locally for development or in-store deployment.

The application should use React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and Socket.IO for real-time communication. A role-based authentication system should be implemented to control user access and functionality.

 Key Features Overview

 1. Authentication & User Roles

* Login/Logout functionality with secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt)
* Token-based session handling (e.g., JWT)
* Role-based access control (RBAC) with at least three roles:

  * Admin: Full access to all settings and user management
  * Staff: Access to POS and order handling
  * Viewer: Read-only access to orders and reports
* Permissions enforced on both frontend UI and backend API routes

 2. Online Customer Order Module

* Customers can place orders online (via sample UI or REST endpoint)
* Orders should appear in real-time in the admin/staff dashboard
* Socket.IO used for real-time updates between client and server

 3. Point of Sale (POS) Interface

* Dedicated POS screen for staff with product quick-pick, quantity, and checkout
* Bill generation and receipt view
* Option to mark orders as "Paid" or "Pending"

 4. Settings & Configuration Panel

* Manage:

  * Product catalog (add/edit/remove items, prices, categories)
  * Services (e.g., online orders, delivery, discounts, taxes)
  * Store hours
  * UI preferences (e.g., Dark Mode toggle)
  * User management (Admins only)

 5. Dashboard & Reports

* Overview of today's orders, sales, and stock status
* Sales analytics with filter (e.g., by date, product)
* Export data (CSV/PDF optional)

 6. Sample Data & Local Development Support

* App should come with seed data for:

  * Products
  * Customers
  * Sample orders
  * Sample users for each role
* Everything runs on `localhost`
* Minimal setup (`npm install && npm start`)

 Tech Stack & Architecture

 Backend – Node.js + Express

* REST APIs and Socket.IO events
* JWT-based authentication
* Role-based route guards
* In-memory data for dev or lightweight DB (LowDB, SQLite, or MongoDB)
* Modular architecture (routes, controllers, middleware, models)

 Frontend – React

* Routing via `react-router-dom`
* State via Context API or Redux
* Protected routes and conditional UI rendering based on roles
* Dark mode and mobile-responsive layout
* Componentized pages:

  * `LoginPage`
  * `Dashboard`
  * `POSPanel`
  * `OrderBoard`
  * `SettingsPanel`
  * `UserManagement`

 WebSockets – Real-time Communication

* Real-time order push and status updates using Socket.IO
* Bi-directional sync between POS, dashboard, and order view

 Security Best Practices (Local Dev Ready)

* Passwords hashed using bcrypt
* JWT tokens signed with secret key
* Role middleware to protect sensitive endpoints
* CORS configured for development

 Extras to Consider

* Offline Mode Support (for POS using local storage/cache)
* Print Receipts via browser print or Bluetooth printer
* Barcode Scanner Integration (optional)
* Unit Tests for backend routes and frontend logic
* Dockerized setup for future deployment
